### Project Setup

1. Use this repo as a template for any python/database based projects.
1. Start up the project by creating a new Gitpod workspace. During that process the repo will automatically use docker to set up all the dependencies and set up a database for you with pgadmin enabled. Additionally all of the python modules should be installed as well. 
1. Credentials for the pgadmin/database are in the docker-compose file.
1. Default database information is in the pgadmin_import.json file.
1. Execute/run the connection.py file and if the connection prints "Connection to PostgreSQL DB successful" you're good to go.

### pgAdmin 4
Documentation, albeit pretty rough to look at, can be found for this [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/user_interface.html)

### PostgresQL
The [https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) tutorial and documentation is a very helpful resource to have throughout the project.
